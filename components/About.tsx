          About Me
        </h2>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I am a full-stack web developer with a focus on performance, usability, and clean
          architecture. Over the past few years, I have built scalable products using technologies like
          <strong className="font-semibold"> Next.js, React, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS</strong>.
          <br /><br />
          I care deeply about writing maintainable code, building meaningful features, and
          collaborating across teams. Whether it's building an API, optimizing frontend UX, or deploying to the cloud â€” I am focused on outcomes, not just code.
